TwoSpaceRunner is a 2D infinite runner game in which user has to control 2 players simulataneously while avoiding the obstacles.
The current project is just like a blueprint to create your own game based on the idea implemented in project.
Currently I've used some open source assets, you can create your own assets and use them.
You can add new features to the game like powerups or something.


Last thing I'm a beginner in game development so this project isn't top notch, it's my first project overall so there might be few bugs/issues
